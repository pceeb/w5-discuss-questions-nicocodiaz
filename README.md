## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  


2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).  

3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).  

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).


Question 1: Throughout this final project, specifically with the FishBase research, we will be analyzing eDNA. eDNA, or environmental DNA, is DNA that can be extracted from environmental samples. This includes water and soil. This can be analyzed because all living organisms leave behind traces of their DNA wherever they go. Thus, biologists can determine what species of organisms have been in a specific area of interest. To elaborate, eDNA is composed of nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast DNA. For the purposes of this project, since the eDNA is extracted from water, the researcher must consider that the DNA released by an organism can only be detected for a few days before degrading.

Question 2: We will be provided eDNA sequences from a sample of sea water from Zach Gold's lab. This eDNA data will be analyzed to determine what species has passed through this specific sample of sea water being examined and tested. We will also be provided additional data that expresses a varible of the species that were found to travel through the specific sample of sea water. This could include data pertianing to velocity, weight of fish, or estimated age of fish, if we had to guess.

Question 3: We would like to collect the data, from both the eDNA results and the variable results, and insert it into a group repository. From there, we will organize the eDNA to determine the species that traveled through the specific sample of sea water. After, we will organize the variable data, dependent upon the type of data (highest to lowest, alphabetical order, reverse order, etc.) Then, we will analyze the data from both the eDNA data and the variable data. This will give us the proper, organized information to form a phylogenetic tree of the species found. It is possible that we may include some sort of graph to depict our results.

Question 4: The output will be an organized view of the data provided, both eDNA and the variable. It is our hope that our code will provide researchers an orderly and efficient way to access data about a specific species or a characteristic of the variable. At this time, we are unsure if the output will provide number values or written word (i.e. species, family, color, size).

Question 5:I will be using the sed function to process and clean up the data files to only contain the data we need to analyze after we choose the variable. 

Question 6: Our biggest concerns are our lack of experience. We fear that we will not be able to come up with the appropriate commands to code for what we want to manipulate or fix in the provided data. We are also afraid that we are not fully aware of the complexities of this project yet and will have a difficult time starting.
